        <p>
          Luna Café was founded in 2025 by three passionate creators — <strong>Mursib</strong>,
          <strong>Ishaan</strong>, and <strong>Jason</strong>. What began as a shared love for quality
          coffee and meaningful spaces has grown into a warm, welcoming café focused on community,
          comfort, and craftsmanship.

        <p>
          Inspired by the calm and beauty of the moon, Luna Café represents a place where guests
          can unwind, recharge, and enjoy moments of quiet reflection. Just like the moonlight,
          our café aims to bring a sense of calm and brightness to your day.
